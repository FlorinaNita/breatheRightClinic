                            Worldwide the coronavirus pandemic continues to cause widespread acute respiratory disease
                            caused by SARS-CoV-2. The numbers of patients suffering from pneumonia, gastrointestinal
                            organ problems, acute myocardial lesions and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system are
                            increasing across the globe. Recent studies even suggest neurological involvement, where
                            SARS-CoV-2 affects the central and peripheral nervous systems, including effects on muscle
                            function.

                            Physiotherapy can help you manage some of these symptoms through breathing specific
                            exercises to combat breathlessness, pacing strategies to manage fatigue and advice/advocacy
                            to sort out other issues. It is important that you are supported and believed - something we
                            feel strongly about. We know exercise is effective
                            in managing a number of chronic disease, may not be the answer in addressing Long Covid. It
                            is essential that we recognize the warning signs.

                    Around one in ten people who contract coronavirus (COVID-19) will experience long-term
                    consequences,
                    otherwise known as Long COVID. Long COVID is the umbrella term used for the wide range of
                    symptoms
                    reported
                    in patients with issues related to COVID-19 that last for 12 weeks or more. These symptoms
                    involve
                    many
                    different body systems. A better understanding of the underlying pathologies and the impact
                    of

                    sufficient
                    evidence, interventions for the physical therapy management of Long COVID are still highly
                    debated
                    and
                    should be individualised and risk-stratified.

                    When New York City became the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic
                    in
                    March,
                    Breathe Right Clinic rapidly reconfigured its services to treat the flood of critically ill
                    and
                    recovering patients. Since then, Breathe Right Clinic's multidisciplinary team has
                    continually
                    adapted its
                    approach to the evolving crisis.

                    The first wave of acute patients lasted approximately two months. “Early on, our team’s
                    focus
                    was on
                    inpatient care,” explains Dr. Moroz. “The volume was very high, and we were all working
                    incredibly
                    hard to
                    keep up with it.”
                    By late spring, Breathe Right Clinic’s COVID-19–positive inpatient unit had begun to empty
                    out,
                    and
                    the
                    team’s clinicians were increasingly called upon to consult with other services whose
                    patients
                    with
                    coronavirus had entered recovery. Finally, in June, Breathe Right Clinic’s outpatient units
                    were
                    able to
                    reopen, with a growing number of patients needing care for the long-term sequelae of
                    COVID-19.

                    “This is a disease that affects every single organ system,” notes Jonathan H. Whiteson, MD,
                    associate
                    professor of rehabilitation medicine, vice chair for Breathe Right Clinic’s clinical
                    operations,
                    and
                    medical
                    director of cardiac rehabilitation. “We’re seeing people who presented with respiratory
                    failure
                    and
                    need
                    pulmonary rehabilitation, people who’ve had strokes and need stroke rehabilitation, people
                    who’ve
                    had heart
                    attacks and need cardiac rehabilitation. Many patients are struggling with a chronic
                    post-viral
                    fatigue
                    syndrome, which we’re treating with lifestyle changes as well as exercise therapy and other
                    modalities.
                    We’re currently developing a comprehensive post–COVID-19 rehabilitation clinic to address
                    these
                    varied
                    needs.”
